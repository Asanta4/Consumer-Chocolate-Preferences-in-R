# Chocolate Data Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of various chocolate products to identify trends, preferences, and quality metrics in the chocolate industry. Utilizing R for statistical analysis and visualization, this project offers insights into factors affecting chocolate ratings and popularity.

## Project Details

### Introduction
The motivation behind this analysis is to understand the characteristics that contribute to the quality and consumer preference of chocolate products. By analyzing aspects such as cocoa percentage, origin, and manufacturer, we aim to provide a data-driven approach to evaluating chocolate.

### Data Set
The dataset includes information on different chocolate bars, including:
- Cocoa percentage
- Country of origin
- Manufacturer
- Ratings and reviews

### Technologies Used
- **R**: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **R Markdown**: For documenting the analysis process and findings.
- **Libraries**: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, among others.

### Analysis Overview
1. **Data Cleaning**: Standardizing data entries and handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing distribution of ratings, cocoa percentages, and other categorical data.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to deduce relationships and test hypotheses.
4. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data to identify patterns and trends.

### Results
Our analysis uncovered several interesting patterns, such as the relationship between cocoa content and ratings, and preferences for origin of cocoa beans. Detailed results and visualizations are included in the final report.
